## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Identify which stores and departments drive the most revenue
- Analyze how holidays and markdown strategies impact sales
- Uncover seasonal trends in customer behavior
- Forecast future sales to support decision-making

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Prophet** for time series forecasting
- **EDA** and trend decomposition (seasonality, holiday impact)
- **Correlation and markdown analysis**
- **PDF & Canva-based stakeholder reporting**

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Store Type A** consistently drives the highest sales volume
- Sales **peak around holidays** like Black Friday and Christmas
- Only **MarkDown1** shows slight correlation with increased sales
- **Fuel prices** and **temperature** have minimal impact on sales
- Forecasting reveals **reliable seasonal trends** for planning

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

- Reallocate markdown budgets from ineffective categories (2–4)
- Use forecasts to align **inventory and staffing** with demand peaks
- Replicate successful tactics used by **Store Type A**
- Run **A/B testing** to validate promotional effectiveness in real time
